- Web application following Udemy course instructor Bhrugen Patel

* Course is in .NET 5. This project is adapted to .NET 6 (mostly Program.cs instead of Startup.cs)

* This project is following Microservices architecture. Some classes are duplicated between projects to keep the microservices decoupled.
* Microservices are in the same Solution only for learning purposes.
* Payment processor is not customized (until further coding). It's a fake/dummy processor for didactic reasons.
* Azure Service Bus instance will be closed later to avoid unnecessary charges (using free account with funds valid for 30 days).
* Course uses INT variable types for IDs. This project uses GUIDs.
